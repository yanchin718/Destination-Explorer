    <h4>
      First Time Travelers Tips for Packing
    </h4>
    <p>
      Build a Travel Capsule Wardrobe: Limit your clothing to around 30 versatile items that can be mixed and matched to create multiple outfits. This helps reduce clutter and makes packing easier.<br>
      Use Packing Cubes: Organize your suitcase with packing cubes to keep your items neat and categorized. This method not only saves space but also makes it easier to find what you need.<br>
      Decant Toiletries into Travel-Size Containers: Instead of bringing full-size bottles, transfer only the amount you need into smaller containers. This saves space and complies with TSA liquid limits.<br>
      Prevent Wrinkles with Dry Cleaning Bags: Use dry cleaning bags to wrap blazers and dress shirts to protect them from wrinkles. For ties, roll them up and stash them in your socks.<br>
      Plan to Do Laundry on the Road: Pack fewer clothes by planning to wash items during your trip. This can help you travel with just a carry-on, even for longer trips.
